What is SEO and explain the Importance of Seo?
SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a digital marketing strategy and practice aimed at improving the visibility and ranking of a website or web page on search engine results pages
The primary goal of SEO is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to a website by optimizing various elements of the site to align with search engine algorithms and user intent. SEO encompasses a wide range of tactics and techniques, both on-page and off-page, to enhance a website's online presence.
Importance of SEO are as follows
1)Increased Visibility: When people search for information, products, or services online, they typically click on one of the top results that appear on the first page of search engine results. SEO helps your website rank higher in these results, increasing its visibility to potential visitors
2)Higher Organic Traffic: Websites that rank well in search engine results receive a substantial amount of organic traffic, meaning users find your site naturally without clicking on paid ads. Organic traffic is often more valuable because it tends to be more targeted and cost-effective
3)Targeted Traffic: SEO allows you to target specific keywords and phrases relevant to your business or content. This means that the people who find your website through search engines are more likely to be interested in what you offer, increasing the chances of conversion.
